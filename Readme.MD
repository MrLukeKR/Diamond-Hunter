## Using the Map Editor
To use the Map Editor, download the JAR file from the /bin folder and run it (via CLI or double-click). 

You will be presented with a screen showing the map and some tools at the bottom to show you where your cursor is currently pointing, whether or not it contains an item and if it blocks the player from walking on it. 

You will also find some items that can be placed on the map. These are toggle buttons, so click once and place your item anywhere on the map. You can keep replacing items until you have selected another item or deselected your current item. 

If you want to use this map in the diamond hunter game, go to File > Save Item Map and select an appropriate File Name and Path to save to. 

Note: from this menu you can also load in custom TileSets and Maps - The default map is loaded on startup.

## Loading the Items into Diamond Hunter
To load the items in, run the _new_ version of Diamond Hunter in the repository. 

This new version will have a new menu entry "Load Items". Using the directional arrows, navigate down to it and hit enter. From here you can select the file you made from a dialog box - just navigate to where you saved it and click open.

The game is now ready to play!
